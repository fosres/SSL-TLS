<h2 id="nonfree-software">Nonfree software required</h2>

A nonfree program submits the users to the power of the program's
developer.  This is an <a
href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">injustice
to the user</a>.  Alas, most Google services require running nonfree
code.

<ul>
<li>
Even making a Google account requires running nonfree software
(Javascript sent by the site).
</li>

<li>
Google Groups and Google+ Communities require the use of <a
href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
Javascript software</a>, so please don't host your discussions there.
</li>

<li>
Google Docs requires <a
href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
Javascript code</a> to edit a document, or even to look at one with
the usual URL.  It may be possible to merely look at some kinds of
documents without running the nonfree Javascript code, through a
different URL, but I don't know.
</li>

<li>
<p>
Around 2011, Google Maps worked without running Javascript code.  Then
something broke: the page worked fine except that the map did not
appear.
<p>
Nowadays, nothing whatsoever appears if Javascript is disabled.
</li>

<li id="js">
Youtube
requires <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/whats-wrong-with-youtube.html">nonfree
software (Javascript code) for normal use of the site</a>; after
changes Google made in August 2017, <em>nothing</em> is visible in a
typical Youtube page without running its nonfree Javascript code.
You can bypass this with youtube-dl, but we have no way to make
Youtube work in a browser.

<p>For my own freedom's sake, I do not run the nonfree Javascript
software sent by Youtube.  I advise you to refuse likewise; what's
directly at stake is your own freedom.

<p>For the sake of everyone else's freedom, it is my duty not to post
anything on Youtube, or refer people to anything on Youtube.  Although it
is true that they could bypass the problem by running youtube-dl, I expect
most users would view the Youtube page in their browsers with nonfree software,
and I don't want to send people in that direcion.

<p>You can post an audio or video file on your own web site.  Just put
up the WebM file and link to it as if it were an ordinary page.
All browsers can handle that.
</li>

<li>In general, most Google services require running nonfree
Javascript code.  If you refuse to run that (for instance, by running
LibreJS), you'll see that you should not use those services.
</li>

<li>Google censored installation of Samsung's <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/03/google-pulls-ad-blocking-app-for-samsung-phones">ad-blocker,</a> saying that blocking ads is "interference" with the sites that advertise (and surveil users through ads).

<p>The ad-blocker is proprietary software, just like the program
(Google Play) that Google used to deny access to install it.  I would
refuse to have either of them on my
computer.  <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">Using
a nonfree program</a> gives the owner power over you, and Google has
exercised that power.
</li>

</ul>
<hr />

<h2 id="surveillance">Surveillance</h2>

To identify yourself to a Google service is a grave error.

<ul>
<li>
  Google "santizes" it total search logs, then publishes them; but it
  declines to describe the process of "sanitization", and there
  <a href="http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1058&context=jpc">is
  evidence that users can be tracked through them</a>.
</li>


<li>
<a href="http://www.alternet.org/google-using-gmail-build-psychological-profiles-hundreds-millions-people?paging=off">Gmail</a>
was planned from the start as a massive surveillance system, to make
psychological profiles not only of Gmail users but of everyone who
sends mail to Gmail users.
</li>

<li>
Google quietly
<a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/how-to-disable-google-ad-tracking-gmail-youtube-browser-history>
combined its ad-tracking profiles with its browsing profiles.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Google has found a way to 
<a href="https://consumerist.com/2017/05/23/google-following-your-offline-credit-card-spending-to-tell-advertisers-if-their-ads-work/">track
most credit card purchases in the US</a>, even those not done through
a phone, and correlate that with people's online actions.</p>
<p>
Google can't do either side to me, since I pay cash and don't carry a
mobile phone, and it doesn't know what web sites I look at.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Google Play 
<a href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/google-play-store-policy-raises-privacy-concerns-331116">sends
app developers the personal details of users that install the app</a>.
<p>
Merely asking users' "consent" for this is not enough to legitimize it.
We know that most users have given up on reading just what they are
"consenting" to, and the reason is that they are accustomed to being
told, "If you want to use this service, you must consent to blah blah
blah."
<p>
To truly protect people's privacy, we must stop Google from getting
this personal information in the first place!
</li>

<li>
<p>
Google <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/all-the-data-facebook-google-has-on-you-privacy">
stores a huge amount of data</a> on each user. This can include, in
addition to the user's search history and advertising
profile:
<ul>
  <li>A timeline of the user's location throughout each
    day</li>
  <li>Data on the usage of non-Google phone
    apps</li>
  <li>'Deleted' emails and files uploaded to Google
    Drive</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Facebook and Google joined with ISPs to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180412/13203739616/public-attention-forces-facebook-to-retreat-anti-privacy-alliance-with-isps-california.shtml">defeat a privacy initiative</a>
in California.
</li>

<li>
<p>
Collecting the many ways Google is involved with US government
surveillance, abroad and in the US, amounts
to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/20/googles-earth-how-the-tech-giant-is-helping-the-state-spy-on-us">quite
a package</a>.
</p>
</li>

</ul>
<hr />

<h2 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/17/google-suspends-customer-accounts-for-reselling-pixel-phones">
Google cuts off accounts</a> for users that resell Pixel phones.
They lose access to all of their mail and documents stored
in Google servers under that account.
<p>
It should be illegal to put any "terms of service" on a physical
product.  It should also be illegal to close an account on a service
without letting the user download whatever was stored there.
<p>
These events provide another reason why schools must never ask
a student to use a service account linked to the student's name.
</li>

</ul>
<hr />

<h2 id="censorship">Censorship</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Amazon and
    Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17308508/amazon-web-services-signal-domain-fronting-ban-response">have
      cut off domain-fronting</a>, a feature
    used to
    enable people in tyrannical countries to reach
    communication systems that are banned there.

</li>

<li>
Google has
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/pakistans-youtube-ban-lifted-as-government-gets-say-over-content">agreed
to perform special censorship of Youtube</a> for the government of
Pakistan, deleting views that the state opposes.
<p>
This will help the illiberal Pakistani state
<a href="http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/001146.html">suppress
dissent</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
Youtube's "content ID"
<a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/youtubes-copyright-cave-in-the-unwarranted-takedown-of-rand-pauls-campaign-announcement-video">
automatically deletes posted videos</a> in a way
copyright law does not require.
</li>

<li>
YouTube has made private deals with the copyright industry to
<a href="http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/youtube-mashup-remix-copyright-universal/">censor
works that are fair use</a>.
<p>
<a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/universal-music-group-and-youtube-agree-to-forget-about-fair-use">More
information</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
Google shut off Alexa O'Brien's Google Drive account, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/journalist-nearly-banned-from-youtube-and-gmail-for-pos-1815314182">denying her
access</a> to it, because her reporting on Chelsea Manning's trial
included copies of al-Qa'ida propaganda that was presented as evidence.
</li>

<li>
<p>Google is deleting porn artists' porn videos <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kgwnp/porn-on-google-drive-error">from their own private accounts, quietly and mysteriously</a>.</p>
<p>Never trust a remote storage company to keep anything but a spare backup copy.  When you store that, put your files into an archive and encrypt it so that the company can't tell what's in them -- not even their file names.</p>
</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>
Google told a reporter in 2011 that web sites without "+1" buttons
would be punished with lower search rankings. When she published a
story in Forbes about that, Google pressured Forbes to <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/09/yes-google-uses-its-power-to-quash-ideas-it-doesnt-likei-know-because-it-happened-to-me/">take it down</a>.
